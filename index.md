## Research Experience
### Undergraduate
- **Electrospinning:**
 As the team leader, I have designed the experiment and research targets. With the help of all team members, we've carried out the research on the influence of PVP-based electrospinning on the filtration performance of mask. The filterability and air permeability of mask with spinning attached are tested.<br>
