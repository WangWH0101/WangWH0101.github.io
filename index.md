## Research Experience
### Undergraduate
- **Electrospinning:**
	- As the team leader, I have designed the experiment and research targets. With the help of all team members, we've carried out the research on the influence of PVP-based electrospinning on the filtration performance of mask. The filterability and air permeability of mask with spinning attached are tested.<br>

- **Network state propagation:**
	- The existence of various kinds of networks brings a large number of topological structures composed of different nodes and corresponding states. The research on network science has been showing increasing importance in many domains, such as epidemic prediction, rumor spreading and recommendation system. I've studied the SI and SIS propagation of node states under randomly generated undirected networks of poisson and regular distribution. The fractions of infected nodes under continuous and discrete propagations are compared. Besides, the theoretical calculation methods including AME, PA and mean field(MF)[^1] are introduced and tested.<br>

### Postgraduate
- **International Citation Ratio and Citation Preference:**
	- Based on the database of Web of Science (WoS), I have used the null model of random citation and further explored the mathematical reason for the abnormal phenomenon that the proportion of foreign citations in total citations received by China has been dramatically decreasing compared with other main countried with relatively huger scientific output.
