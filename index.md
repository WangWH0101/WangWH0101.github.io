## Research Experience
### Undergraduate
- **Electrospinning:**
	- **Keywords:**<br>
	Polyvinyl pyrrolidone(PVP), Electrospinning, Filterability, Air permeability
	- As the team leader, I have designed the experiment and research targets. With the help of all team members, we've carried out the research on the influence of PVP-based electrospinning on the filtration performance of mask. The filterability and air permeability of mask with spinning attached are tested.<br>

- **Network State Propagation:**
	- **Keywords:**<br>
	Complex networks, Stochastic binary-state networks, Network construction, Propagation dynamics, Theoretical computation 
	- The existence of various kinds of networks brings a large number of topological structures composed of different nodes and corresponding states. The research on network science has been showing increasing importance in many domains, such as epidemic prediction, rumor spreading and recommendation system. I've studied the SI and SIS propagation of node states under randomly generated undirected networks of poisson and regular distribution. The fractions of infected nodes under continuous and discrete propagations are compared. Besides, the theoretical calculation methods including AME, PA and mean field(MF)[^1] are introduced and tested. This study is basiclly done through Matlab.<br>

### Postgraduate
- **International Citation Ratio (ICR) and Citation Preference:**
	- **Keywords:**<br>
	Big data processing and analysis, Citation network, Web of science(WoS) database, International citation ratio(ICR), Zscore, Citation preference
	- Based on the database of Web of Science (WoS), I have used the null model of random citation and further explored the mathematical reason for the abnormal phenomenon that the proportion of foreign citations in total citations received by China has been dramatically decreasing compared with other main countries of scientific output. By analogy with concentration problems, I have found the key factor that is how many papers a country cites compared with others in a year and successfully verified it in the original database. In short, it can be simply attributed to that the more you publish, the more likely you would suffer the pressure of ICR decline. In addition, the Z-score of citation has been calculated at country level to show the international citation preference of main countries. Besides, the country-to-country Z-Score has shown an obvious clustering phenomenon, demonstrating the collaboration stength in the corresponding citation network. In this research, I've cleaned and arranged the enormous original WoS data from 1970 to 2018, while generated a large number of structured data files for analysis and future work. This work is based on Python in Google server with over 20000 lines.<br> (*undergoing groupwork, first contributor, to be submitted*)<br>

- **Influence of Counting Methods on Institution Level Ranking:**
	- **Keywords:**<br>
	Big data processing and analysis, Counting methods, Institution rankings, Institution name disambiguation, Inflation, Correlation
	- The ranking of academic bodies (e.g. country, institution and person) will unavoidably need to measure their research output and impact. Publication and citation are the most widely used counting targets. The counting of publication reflects the academic volume, while the counting of citation measures the scientific impact to some extent. However, different counting methods have shown far different ranking results. Since Marianne Gauffriau have given a normative and rigorous definition of counting methods[^2] and many so called institution level only discussed universities, it's necessary to take this opportunity to carry out a complete and accurate research on this topic. After the restoration of WoS database, I've matched each author to his/her address segments and carried out the institution name disambiguation(IND) with an improved AI based approach.[^3] A total of six counting methods are utilized for publication and citation from counting at institution level in WoS data between 2000 and 2016. The main discovery is the classification of counting methods into three groups and the disadvantage of huge-crowd strategy under whole counting. <br>

### Extended research
- **Weeding equipment platform:**
	- **Keywords:**<br>
	Visual navigation, Weeding, Soft shaft, Seedling avoidance, Tobacco field
	- Tobacco is an important cash crop, while the vigorous weeds in the tobacco field have been seriously affecting the growth and development of tobacco plants, resulting in the reduction of related product’s yield and quality. Therefore, the weeds in tobacco field should be removed in time after uncovering the film. However, at present, weeding is mainly done manually with high labor intensity and low efficiency in hilly and mountainous areas, which account for a large proportion in China. As a result, I've cooperated with students from College of Engineering and Technology to develop an automatic weeding platform suitable for relevant areas. The equipment mainly consists of weeding mechanism
with soft shaft and seedling avoidance mechanism. A utility model patent of the design is in the pending process. We are now working on the visual navigation part with the help of Donkeycar.[^4] A virtual environment of tobacco field is built in unity to optimize the parameters in model.<br>
